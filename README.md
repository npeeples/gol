Conway's Game of Life
=====================

This is an implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) using javascript in the browser. It is very basic, assuming dead cells around a grid. It was an experiment to see if I could get it working with [requirejs](http://requirejs.org/), [lodash](http://lodash.com), and [knockout](http://knockoutjs.com/).
